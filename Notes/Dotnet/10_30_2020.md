## Functions
### Scalar Functions
- Returns a single calue
- Some built in functions:
	- lower()
	- upper()
	- substring()
	- char_length()
- Built in functions to deal with Dates and Numeric values
	- Format()
	- now()
	- round()

## Triggers
### Types of triggers:
1. DML Triggers
2. DDL Triggers
3. Logon Triggers

### When do triggers execute:
- Events: insert, update, delete, and truncate
- before tiggers: invoked **before** an event occurs
- after triggers: invoked **after** an event occurs
- instead of triggers

### Differences of triggers:
- can not have parameters
- not executed manually
- require an event and action when created

### Syntax:
```sql
create trigger name { before | after | instead of } event [or ...] }
	on table
	[for [each] {row | statement} ]
	[when (condition)]
	execute procedure function_name (arguments)
```

## Views
- Virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query
- it can either show all the rows of a tbale or specific rows based on certain conditions
- hows specific fields to an end user
	- promotes security and hides complexity

### Tables vs. Views
- both made up of rows and columns
- views are virtual tables build off the definition of tables
- views speed up data retrieval

## Transactions
- unit of work that eiuther succeeds completely or fails
- used to describe a group of queries that are executed as a batch that should completely succeed or not have any effect on the database at all
- **ACID**
	- stands for *atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability*
	- describes the characteristics of a transaction

### AC
- **Atomic**
	- all or nothing
	- either the transaction completely succeeds without errors and persists to a non volatile data storage system or fails
- **Consistent**
	- guarantees committed transaction state
	- makes sure that your transaction is not half finished
	- consistency is a property ensuring that only valid data following all rules and constraints is written in the database
		- when a transaction results in invalid data, the database reverts to its previous state

### ID
- **Isolation**
	- guarantees the individuality of each transaction and prevents them from being affected from other transactions
	- ensure that transaction are securely and independently processed at the same time wihtout interference, but does not ensure the order of transactions
	- two transactions, affecting same data, one will have to wait
- **Durable**
	- a transaction isn't considered complete until it is persisted in a non-volatile data storage
		- device can turn off and data will still be saved

### Degrees of Isolation
- **Isolation levels** define the defree to which a transaction must be isloated form the data modifications made by any other transaction in the db system
- ways other transactions can affect your transaction:
	- **Dirty  Read**
		- when you transaction reads uncommitted updates done by another transaction
	- **Non Repeatable Read**
		- when your transaction reads committed updates done by anohter transaction
	- **Phantom Read**
		- some rows may be added or removed due to the updates done by another transaction
- to proect transactions from being affected by these, you have isolation levels

### Isolation Levels
- Read uncommitted (zero isloation)
	- does not protect transaction from anything, your transaction can read uncommitted data from other transactions
	- useful for when you read and write all the time, like netflix, or you're tracking number of covid cases, you can just reload
	- default for postgre
- Read committed
	- protects transaction from dirty read, but not from non-repeatable read
		- meaning you can stilll read committed data from other transactions
	- locks updates unless committed
- Repeatable read
	- protects transaction from non-repeateable read but not from phantom read
	- when querying batches of data you'd still be able to get a different set of rows when you query the table before and after updates from another table occur
	- locks row
- Serializable
	- protects tranaction from phantom read
	- guarantees total isolation
	- essentially locking data set you're working wtih other transactions

## Design Patterns
### Repository Design Pattern
- container where the data access logic is stored
- separate logic that retriees and manipulates data (in the DB) and maps it (entities of DB to entities ot BL) to logic that acts on the BL models
- you want BL to be agnostic of whatever dat storage system you might have
- Implementaion:
	- Data Layer/DB Layer
	- Repo class (possibly mapper class)

### Facade  Design Pattern
- creating a facade to hide the complex subsystems (if they exist) that implementation might depend on
	- makes it easier to access the necessary methods you would need
- Implementaion:
	- creating an interface that encapsulates these subsystems
	- IMapper interface (combines the different interfaces into an easily referenced interface)
