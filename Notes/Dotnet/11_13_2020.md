## Sessions
- Temporary and interactice information interchange between two or more communicating devices or a computer and user
- HTTP:
	- request data associated wtiha  sessio nis a plain text document
	- It is structured in a precise way determined byu the communication protocol
	- 3 parts:
		- line
		- header
		- body
	- Request has no idea what a session is, therefore the server doesn't either
- Can store information
- Implemented by multi-threading or sub processes
- There are methods to create a new sessio, access current sessions, and store information in them
- Each user has their own session

	- Deleted when browser session ends
	- Timeouts for sessions
