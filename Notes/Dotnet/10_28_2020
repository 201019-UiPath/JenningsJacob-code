Data Access
Select Statement
	used for retrieving data from the database
	clauses:
		select:		sepecifies what columns to have in the result set
		from:		specifies what table to query
		where:		defines a condition, filtering out rows that don't match
		group by:	aggregates multiple rows into one, if they have the same values for all the expressions in the group by list
		having:		defines a condition for filtering after group by
		order by:	specifies the sort order of the result set
	logical order of operations to the select statement:
		from, where, group by, having, select, order by

Join
	combine data back together in a query that was spread out into many tables by a DB's design
	defined in a from clause in a select statement
	kinds:
		Full
		Inner
		Left
		Right
		Cross join: implements cartesian product

Set operations
	used to combine the results of select queries
	Union
		gives you all rows that are found in either query, wihtout duplicates
	Union all
		gives you all rows found in either query, period, including duplicates
	Intersect
		all rows that are in both queries
	except
		set difference

Subqueries
	sometimes, the most natural way to express a query is with a condition based on another query
	operations:
		in
		not in
		exists
		any
		all

when dropping tables:
	1. drop tables that are dependent upon other tables first
	2. then drop other tables

when creating tables:
	1. create table with no dependencies
	2. then create table with dependencies
