## Sequences
Sequence is a container in which activities are placed one after amother and excuted linearly
- Enables the user to create linear processes
- Can serve as a stand-alone automation project or can be included as part of a flowchart
- can be reused

Example: A sequence that asks the user for his name, age, and country then displays them

## Control FLow and its Types
#### Control Flow
The order in which activities or actions are executed in a workflow
- Used to define the decisions to be made during the execution of a workflow
- Enable users to define rules and automate conditional statements within a project
- found in Activities panel under Workflow -> Control

#### Types of Control FLow
- **Decision Based**: Choose between two (or more) parts of a program when  a specific condiiton is met
- **Iteration Based**: Keep executing a particular part of htt program until a specific condition is met

## Decision Control
Helps the user decide the execution flow of th program bsed on certain conditions

#### If Statement
Contains a statement with a condition and two sets of instructions (Then & Else) as outcomes
![IfStatement](../images/UiPath/If.png)

#### Switch Activity
Executes a set of statemnests out of multiple, based on the value of a specific expression
