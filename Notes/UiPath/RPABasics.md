## Programming Constructs in RPA
#### Process
Defined as a series of steps, activites and decisions involved in the way work in accomplished
1. Typically 2 ways to represent a process
   1. A ***sequence***, where actions come one after another
   2. A ***flowchart***, where therre are multiple decision points and logical branches 
2. The process chosen for automation is split into simple actions and mapped in the RPA tool
3. The RPA developer analyzes and configures the mapped process by introducing decision points, variables, pre-defined operations, and other types of elemetns available in the RPA tool
4. Once the logic is replicated in the workflow, the process is ready for automation

Common Flowchart Symbols:

#### RPA Programming Constructs
They are the backbone of any programming language. Some important programming contsructs are:
- Sequence
- Selection
- Repetition
- Control Statements
- Data Types
- Scope
- Validation
- I/O
- Risk/Error Handling
- Optical Character Recognition
