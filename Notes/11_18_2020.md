## Automation Methodology
### RPA Basics
Automation is the process which a procedure is executed with minimal human assistance
- What automation does:
    - Frees human resources to be better utilizaed in more productive work
- Where is Automation used?
    - In business & technology
- Example:
    - Automated bottle-filling stations
- Benefits of Automation:
    - Decreases operational cost
    - Descreases average handling time
    - Assists worker safety
    - Improves productivity
    - Save time, effort, and money
#### What is RPA?
Technology that enables a software program to mimic human actions while interacting with computer applications to accomplish required tasks
- Easy to implement and powerful to scale
- Works 24/7 without making errors
- Creates a digital robotic workforce
- Enables a software program to mimic human actions
- Operates on different applications
- Reads and processes data in a structured form
- Benefits of RPA
    - Increased executiion speed
    - Improved accuracy
    - Improved compliance and governance
    - Reduced cost of process execution
    - Easier scaling
    - Rapid ROI
#### RPA vs. Automation

| platform independent                                                      | platform dependent                                                           |
| mimics user actions and can cognitively take decisions to perform actions | does not mimic user actions and only executes the given program instructions |
| Example: Chatbots, etc                                                    | Example: Calculators, washing machines, etc                                  |

#### RPA and AI
RPA is a robot that mimics human actions while AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines
- AI:
    - Natural language processing
    - Machine learning
    - Natural Language Understanding
    - Chatbots
- RPA:
    - High-volume processes
    - Labor-intensive processes
    - Rule-based & repetitive processes
    - Processes with structured data
- Blending AI into RPA 
    - AI provied through AI Fabric which applies the cognitive power of AI to any software that can be automated by RPA. AI Fabric provides robots with the skills for:
        - Document understanding
        - Visual understanding
        - Conversational understanding

#### RPA and Emerging Ecosystem
Several technologies are emerging in the RPA ecosystem
- Process mining
- Intelligent OCR
- Reporting software
- Workflow management tools

#### Industries best suited for RPA
RPA solutions are being deployed in various industries globally. Some of the industries that benefit from RPA are
- Banking  and finance
- Insurance
- Healthcare
- Manufacturing
- Customer Service
- Travel/Transportation/Logistsic

#### Business units best suited for RPA
Some of the business units where RPA can be used for automating the processes are
- Sales
- Human resources
- Operations
- Information Technology
- Supply chain
- Finance and Accounting

#### Processes that can be automated
A process can be automated if it is:
- Rules-driven: rules-based and consistent
- Voluminous: high volumes of transactions
- Data-Intensive: lots of data manipulation and crunching
- Repetitive in Nature: involving manual & repetitve tasks
- Driven by Digital Inputs: begin by receiving data through digital files

### Robots and Their Types
#### Introduction to Robots
Robots are UiPath's execution agents that enable the user to run processes developed in Studio
- Mimic human actions
- Perform actions on applications, files, and data
- Perofrm complex calculations
