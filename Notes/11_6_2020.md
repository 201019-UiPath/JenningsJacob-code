## Request Response Lifecycle
### HTTP Request
- Send from client to server
- 3 parts:
	1. Start line
		- **Method**: describes action to be performed
		- **Target**: describes where to send the request
	2. Header
		- Meta dataa
		- Ex: context type - waht data type the body has
	3. Body
		- Data you want to the server to process

### HTTP Verbs/Methods
- Describes what action the client wants the server to perform on a given resource
- Common verbs:
	- `GET` : show resource
	- `POST` : create a new resource
	- `PUT` : Update resource
	- `DELETE` : delete resource
	- `HEAD` : returns just the headers of a get response

### Safe and Idempotent
- Safe methods
	- a method is said to be **safe** if it does not hcange the state of the resource
	- basically it should not affect the resouce in any way
	- `GET`, `HEAD`
- Ideompotent methods
	- a method is said to be **idempotent** if the state of the resource is only affected once by any changes implemented by this method
	- aside from the initial change, the resouce should not be affected by any subsequent calls to the same method with the same imputs
	- Ex: if you delete a resource, you can call the delte action on the same resource multiple times, but it will only get deleted once
	- `DELETE`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `GET`

### HTTP Response
- From server to client
- 3 parts:
	1. Status Line
		- contains HTTP status codes of describing what happened when interacting with the server
	2. Headers
	3. Body

### HTTP Status Codes
- status codes give a short description of whether an interaction is successful or not
- status codes are grouped by their number
	- 1xx : informational
	- 2xx : communicating success
	- 3xx : redirection
	- 4xx : errors that are the client's fault, client side errors
	- 5xx : errors that are the server's fault, server side errors

## Rest
### ASP.NET MVC Dilemma
- The view is tightly coupled to processing logic
	- Client must wait for its request to be processed and also for the view that the server eventually returns
- Solution
	- decouple the logic that processes the data (backend logic) from the logic that presents your data (frontend)
	- put those into 2 different severs

### Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Architecture style for building software applications that user services available in a network such as the web
- **Service** are an implementaiton of a well defined business functionality
- We want to delegate the whole business logic with the data layer associated with it as a service that returns to the client that necessary data it would need to present to the end user
	-how to present that data is wholly up to the client
	
### REST
- **REpresentational State Transfer**
- Architectural style to design your services
- Guiding principle of REST:
	- client-server
	- stateless
	- chacheable
	- uniform interface
	- layered system
	- code on demand (optional)

### Uniform Interface
- Your service would have an interface defined by four interface constraints
	1. Identification of resources
		- able to identify what resources you're trying to access
	2. Manipulation of resources through representations
		- using the appropriate action verb to access and manipulate your resources
	3. Self-descriptive messages
		- including in the sepsonse any necessary information to process the data, such as the format of the data (if body is JSON, HTML, XML, etc) otherwise the client would process it as text
	4. Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
		- not really implemented as implementing this is very tedious

### Client Server and Layered System
- Client Server
	- Client app must evolve separately from the server app without any dependency on each other 
	- decoupling services from each other
	- services should be independent from each other, even if they call upon each other
- Layered System
	- Constraining the interaction sof your component to the ones in the next layer
	- EX: having an Authorization Service, a subsystem of BL services and another subsystem od DL services
		- layers would be UI > Auth & BL > DL
		- UI components can interact with the authorization services, after being authorized it should be able to call some of the BL components, but it can never access the DL services

### Stateless & Cacheable
- Stateless
	- Server isnt responsible for storing client state
	- The server will not store anything about the latest HTTP request the client made
	- it will treat every request as new
	- no session, no history
- Cacheable
	- Resources from the server can be cached if applicable, these resources themselves must declare to be cacheable
	- Ex:
		- Cacheable request: `GET` requests
		- Non-Cacheable request: `DELETE` requests

### Code on demand (optional)
- Allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the orm of applets or scripts
- We usually send out static resources in the from of JSON or XML
	- but the server can send executable script on the client side to render a part of the UI

### Richardson Maturity Model
- A way to describe how REST compliant your service is
- Grades your API according to the constraints of REST according to levels
	- Level 0
		- uses HTTP, single URI, one method (usually post)
	- Level 1
		- uses HTTP, multiple URIs, still one methd (POST)
		- unique URI for each unique resource
	- Level 2
		- Uses HTTP, multiple URIs, various HTTP methods
		- Operations depend on the action method used
	- Level 3
		- Uses HTTP, mutiple URIs, various HTTP methods, and HATEOAS
