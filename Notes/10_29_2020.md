## ADO.NET
- ActiveX Direct Object
- We use this framework as a middleware to connection Application Logic program to backend
- Two architectures in ADO.NET:
	1. Connected Architecture
		- Reading from data happens when client app and backend are active
		- Reading happens in forward only direction, reading one record at a time
			- Which means to back-tracking of records
	2. Disconnected Architecture
		- Fire and forget the query
		- Once conneciton is made, the backend would sentd results to client which are stored locally
		- The local data source is called `DataSet`
