##Javascript Fundamentals
###Javascript
- **JS** for short
- no correlation to java
- **Functional** language
- **Loosely typed**, has types but theyre determined at runtime
- **Interpreted** by browser not compiled language

###ECMASCRIPT
- Standardization of JS
- ES6 is the latest standardized version

###SUNBONS (Data types)
- Symbols
- Undefined
	- declared variables that aren't intialized
- Null
	- must declare value to be null
- Boolean
- Objects
	- functions are also a data type but they're treated as objects in JS
- Numbers
- Strings

###Scopes in js
- the scope of variable describes where it exists
- 3 scopes:
	1. Function
	2. Global
	3. Block
- Somewhat related to variable declaration
	- when you declare a variable using var because of hoisting it ends up having a global scope
	- when you declare a variable using let, it limits the scope of a variable to the block it is declared in
	- *thus make let not var*

###Other types of variable declarations
- Using const when defining a variable prevents the value of the variable from being changed
- To declare an object you use the object literal syntax
	- Put stuff in {}
	- if you put stuff in [] you're making an arrary, but if you use {} its an object

###Truthy and Falsy
- In js, all values have a boolean equivalent. i.e. you can evaluate actual values instead of boolean expressions
-Falsy values: FUN0NE
	- values that evaluate to false
	- false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, empty string
Truthy vales: literally everything else
	- values that evaluate to true

###Functions in JS
- basic function
- callback function
	- function within a function
- arrow function
	- anonymous function
	- lambda expression basically
- IIFE
	- pronounced iffy
	- stands for immediately invoked function

###Encapsulation
- Since JS is not object-oriented, it has no access modifiers
- You can still achiece encapsulation using closure
- What is a closure?
	- When you have a function within a function, if you declare a variable in the outer function, only the inner function can access it

###Inheritance in JS
- Before ES6, classes weren't a thing in js, but there was such a thing a protoypal inheritance
	- Whenever you try to access a property on an object
