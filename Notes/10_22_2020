Unit Testing
	tests small units of your code
	helpful when you want to make sure everything working (without repeating some actions to get there)
	helpful pinpointing where the code is going wrong
	We will be using Xunit

Parts of unit test
	Arrange
		any setup necessary to prepare for the behavior to test
		assume the thing you want to test works
	Act
		do the thing you want to test
		name the method after the thing you want to test
	Assert
		verify the behavior was as expected
		sometimes on the same step as act

Test Driven Development (TDD)
	1. write tests that fail
	2. implement code to make tests pass
	want to try extreme cases
	want to ensure that your code will fail properly
