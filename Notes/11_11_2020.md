## Dynamic Web Design
### DOM
- **Document Object Model**
- Representation of your HTML document as a tree (made up of nodes) that can be modified using JS
- Used to change document structure, style, and content at runtime

### Selectors
- These are used to identify elements in your DOM
- Types:
	- `document.getElementById()`
	- `document.getElementsByClassName()`
	- `document.getElementsByTagName()`
	- `document.querySelector()`
	- `document.querySelectorAll()`

### Events
- Any type of interaction with the web page
	- User interactions such as clicking a button
- Any significant change in page state
	- Such as when certain elements have been loaded

### Dynamic Web Design
- A web page is dynamic if it reacts to user interaction
	- for example: clicking a button should be able to result in something occuring in your webpage
- If you have a web page that does not change user interaction then the web page is static (also very boring)

### Event Handling with JS
- Event handlers
	- Functions that get called when an event happens
- Event listeners
	- Added to elements, call an event handler when a certain event occurs

## AJAX & Fetch API
### AJAX
- Stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML
- Web dev technique used for updating your page with information from a server without reloading it
- The XML part of AJAX is there because traditionally, the data sent across networks use XML as a format
	- SOAP

### XMLHttpRequest
- Main actor of AJAX
- Object that is used to send a request to the server and receive the response
	- Aagain the XML in its name is for traditional reasons
	- Can utilizae JSON

### Fetch API
- JS Interface for making http requests and processing server responses
- Uses **promises** to achieve asynchronisity
	- Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
	- Promises are objects in JS

## Git
### Teamwork
- Git is distributed version control system
	- people can have different versions of things
	- not one source of truth
- Git has features that lets you work on multiple versions of a project at the same time
- With the ability to work on different features at the same time, git also includes features that allows you to communicate any changes you'd want to make to the working version

### Branching
- It is best practice to have a different branch for any new features you might want to add to the working project
- Commands:
	- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
		- creates new branch starting at the current commit
	- `git branch <branch-name>`
		- creates new brnach without swtiching
	- `git checkcout <branch-name>`
		- switch branches freely
	- `git push`
		- operates on current branch
	- `git pull origin <branch-name>`
		- Pull from a certain branch (like main)

### Branching Terminology
- Remote Branch
	- Branch in remote repository (github)
- Local Branch
	- branch in your local repo
	- can change origins
	- may not necessarily have a remote counterpart
- Tracking Branch
	- aka upstream branch
	- local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch

### Pull Requests
- Don't just push to main
- When you want to merge a completed feature to the main branch, you create a pull request
- With a pull request you are opening any changes you wan to commit to main for peer review, and commments from your other team memberes
- Any changes you've made on the branch with an open pull request gets added to the pull request

### Merge Conflicts
- What happens when two version of code are incompatible
	- the code has edited at the same point by different people
	- this is why we pull often
- When dealing with merge conflicts, have utmost patience, communication is key
