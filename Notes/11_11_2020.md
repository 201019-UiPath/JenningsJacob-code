##Dynamic Web Design
###DOM
- **Document Object Model**
- Representation of your HTML document as a tree (made up of nodes) that can be modified using JS
- Used to change document structure, style, and content at runtime

###Selectors
- These are used to identify elements in your DOM
- Types:
	- `document.getElementById()`
	- `document.getElementsByClassName()`
	- `document.getElementsByTagName()`
	- `document.querySelector()`
	- `document.querySelectorAll()`

###Events
- Any type of interaction with the web page
	- User interactions such as clicking a button
- Any significant change in page state
	- Such as when certain elements have been loaded

###Dynamic Web Design
- A web page is dynamic if it reacts to user interaction
	- for example: clicking a button should be able to result in something occuring in your webpage
- If you have a web page that does not change user interaction then the web page is static (also very boring)

###Event Handling with JS
- Event handlers
	- Functions that get called when an event happens
- Event listeners
	- Added to elements, call an event handler when a certain event occurs

##AJAX & Fetch API
###AJAX
- Stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML
- Web dev technique used for updating your page with information from a server without reloading it
- The XML part of AJAX is there because traditionally, the data sent across networks use XML as a format
	- SOAP

###XMLHttpRequest
- Main actor of AJAX
- Object that is used to send a request to the server and receive the response
	- Aagain the CML in its name is for traditional reasons

###Fetch API
- JS Interface for making http requests and processing server responses
- Uses **promises** to achieve asynchronisity
	- Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
	- Promises are objects in JS
