## Asp.NET Core Web API
###Content Negotiation:
- Whenever client request for a format of data using *Accept* header, this is called content negotiation
- By default, Asp.NET core offers JSON data unless configured
- Some browsers also have default accept headers
	- Edge and IE requests for JSON
-  or user formatter customer of default

### How can you consume an Asp.Net Web API
1. Client-side 
- using JS or any framworks based on client-scripting language
2. Server-side
- `HttpClient` library

### SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
- Architectural approach in which applications make use of services abailable in the network
	- Service Provider
	- Service Consumer
- Both the components interact with each other via messages (text/json/xml) over a *Protocol* (TCP, MSMQ, HTTP(s), named Pipes)

#### Principles of SOA
- **Standardized Service Contract**
	- Service should have a service description document. E.g. [Swagger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio) for REST APIs and [WSDL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wsdl/wsdl_introduction.htm) for SOAP services
- **Loose Coupling**:
	- Each service should be designed in a way that it is self-contained component and has minimal dependencies on other services
- **Abstraction**:
	- Need not to expose the Service internal logic, but it should be defined by its description document and the Service contract
- **Reusability**:
- **Autonomy**:
	- Services are encapsulated in terms of logic and consumer doesn't need to know about the implementation
- **Discoverability**: 
- **Composability**:
	- Using services as building blocks, sophisticated and complex operations
