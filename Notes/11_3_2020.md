## SDLC
### What is SDLC
- Software Development Lifecycle
- A Process used to design, decelop, and test high quality software
- Describes how a certain software was developed

### Big Bang Model
- 3 phases: Design? Build!!! Test?
- Good for prototypes, learning new languages and implementing some new feature without integrating it into the application
![Big Band Model](./images/bigbangmodel.png)

### Waterfall Model
- Rigid
- Highly documented
- You go through each phase once
- Good for project htat require on time delivery
	- Like software for rockets, or military projects

### V-Model
- AKA verification and calidation model
- An extension of the waterfall model and is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresphonding development stage
- the corresponding testing phase of the decelopment phase is planned in parallel

### Agile Development
- Agile is more of a concept than an actual methodology unlike the other models
- It's about being able to develop and deploy software quickly by not wasting time discussing design and planning
- It's about communicating consistently with the client and stakeholders about what they would want in the project and making plans on applying their request in an iterative way so that the current development would be disturbed
- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

### Scrum

#### Backlog
- Contains the user stories that need to be implemented
- Each user story would have a point value, the value is the amount of effort it would take to implement the user story
- During splrint planning, you would assess which user storeis to tomplemetn based on their urgency annd match the total points against your capacity - the total amount of work hours you actually have

#### Project Board
- How you keep track of the project during the development
- Maintained by the scrum master

#### Burndown Chart
- Another way of keeping track of your progress during a sprint
- Is used in sprint review to see the sprint's velocity
- The velocity describes the total amount of points finished during sprint

### YOLO Development
- similar to big bang, but makes it into production
- only has one iteration
- flexible to chnaging requirements
- all about taking requirements from product owner/project manager and coming up with something to show on project presentation
- most apps developed under YOLO development are made once, released, and never updated
