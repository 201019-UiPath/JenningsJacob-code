          <h2 class="text-primary">Where am I from?</h2>
          <p class="text-info">I was born in a place called Hayward, CA. It is a suburb about 15 minutes outside of Oakland, CA in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is know as <i>The Heart of The Bay.</i></p>
        <p class="text-info">Currently, I live in San Jose, CA. This is about 30 miles away from where I grew up. This means I'm close enough to see my family, but far enough to have my own life.</p>

        <p class="text-info">I went to San Jose State University. I studied Computer Engineering as an undergrad and primarily focused on real-time embedded systems. However, I gave that up to pursue Software Engineering</p>

        <p class="text-info">When I am not in working I spend most of my time hanging out with my housemates. We love playing poker, singing kareoke, or watching the newest thing on netflix. I am also an avid gamer.</p>
